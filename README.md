**Selected paper title**   
  
 COSTER: A Tool for Finding Fully Qualified Names of API Elements in Online Code Snippets. 
  
  <br/><br/>
  **Proposed work** 
  
  Our proposed work is to optimize the COSTER tool [1] with a swarm intelligence (SI) algorithm. Moreover, it focuses on parameter tuning to optimize the used algorithm of refining the candidate list.
